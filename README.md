This project is based on Map-Reduce for the Hadoop cluster. The IMap Algorithm (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-21596-4_25) is implemented using pySpark (http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/). 

Note that the version of Thunder (https://github.com/thunder-project/thunder) doesn't properly handle images stored on HDFS. So please use local path on Linux/Windows system.

For detailed output, please change DebugMode to True. Line no: 49.
